This plugin will be updated as and when new versions of MDAL are released and will use the version numbers from MDAL.

# Version 1.0.102

Correct the Editor Assemblies so that it runs under cloud build

# Version 1.0.101

Updates MDAL to version 1.0.1.

This version also moves the conda build to an Asset Post Processor and standardizes assembly names - so there may/will be minor changes in how it operates - including if other assemblies reference this assembly directly.

This version also includes the ability to write to MDAL meshes.

# 0.7.2+3 :

- Fixes Bug whne there is a space in the project name
